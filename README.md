## Abstract
Abstractâ€”With the rapid development of electric vehicles (EVs) industry, EV charging service becomes more and more important. Especially, in the case of suddenly drop of air temperature or open holidays that large-scale EVs seeking for charging devices at a short time. In such scenario, inefficient EV charging scheduling service may lead to a bad service quality, for example, long queueing times for EVs and unreasonable idling time for charging devices. To deal with this issue, this paper propose a Deep-Q-Network (DQN) based two-stage scheduling method for the large-scale EVs charging service. Fine-grained states with two delicate neural networks areproposed to optimize the sequencing of EVs and chargingstation (CS) arrangement. Two efficient algorithms are presented to obtain the optimal EVs charging scheme with a large-scale EVs charging demand. Three case studies show the superiorityof our proposal, in terms of a high service quality (minimizedaverage queuing time of EVs and maximized chargingperformance at both EV and CS sides) and achieve greaterscheduling efficiency.
